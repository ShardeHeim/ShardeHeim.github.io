			Scrunch is an Influencer Marketing Platform that matches 20 million influencers to brands and agencies globally. Scrunch’s Web App works as a directory to refine and filter down influencers based on a range of criteria, including their location, follower range, age, gender, audience ect. You can also run your own marketing campaign on the Scrunch platform. 
			</p>
			<p>
			During my time at Scrunch, I worked on a number of projects including redesigning the end to end web app experience, a mobile app designed just for Influencers, skeleton personas, front end development and design for the Scrunch website, preset development and general content for the company.

		<h2>END TO END EXPERIENCE MAP PROJECT</h2>
		<div class="casestudytitle">
		The Challenge	
		</div>
		<div class="casestudycontent">
			<p>
			The goal of the end-to-end Scrunch project was to map out the user’s complete journey through the platform, to use as a foundation when moving forward with new features and products. The end-to-end map would enable present and future UX Designers of Scrunch to design towards a vision while keeping multiple touch-points, experiences, personas and products in consideration. 
			</p>
			<p>
			My role in the project was to investigate the current user journey of Scrunch. I then tested and updated what that looked like across Scrunch’s different personas and a multitude of use cases.

		Early stage expoloration/research	
		</div>
		<div class="casestudycontent">
		<p>
			Before even starting to design the ideal Scrunch journey, we conducted research into what the current process was. We analysed the experiences/stages of the journeys of Scrunch’s three main personas—Brands, Influencers and Agencies—as well as all the communication channels and how they were being triggered across the platform. This included: emails, notifications, Hubspot events, support outreach from Scrunch ect. 
		</p>
		<p>
			We roughly sketched the steps/stages of each user’s journey, which you can see below. We then conducted user interviews with Scrunch’s stakeholders to validate what we had mapped. 
		</p>
		</div>

		<div class="casestudyimage">
			<img src="images/earlystageexploration.jpg"/>
		</div>

		<div class="casestudycontent">
			<p>
			After our user interviews, we made additional updates to each experience. Adding and removing steps, noting if it was currently being handled in the platform or through some other medium. We digitised each of the user flows so it was easier to consume. 
			</p>
			<p>
			In the example below of the Scrunch Agency process, red markers indicate where the Scrunch platform was being used, while other colours represent other mediums. It was important to make sure that this was an accurate reflections of current Scrunch processes.

		<div class="casestudycontent">
			<p>
			What we ended up with was three user experiences that didn’t touch or interact with one-another. Our last step was to sketch out where the personas correlated and where the touch points were. We drew up four different panels with their steps mapped out, and made note when any of them required input from the other persona.

			Consolidation	
		</div>
		<div class="casestudycontent">
			<p>
			Looking at our map above, we realised we hadn’t addressed the two different manners in which Scrunch was currently set up. It had its additional Agency model which interacted with the exact same users as the Scrunch Platform, just in a more managed way. These were different journeys users would take if they were involved with either an ‘In App’ or a ‘Managed’ campaign. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Using sticky notes, we mapped out a higher level of detail of the 6 journeys and their interactions in-between. Yellow represented Agency, blue was Brand and orange was Influencer. Green lines linked the interactions between each user, and pink marked the type of communication that would occur. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Now consolidated into one single map, this gave us an extensive high-level look into Scrunch as an Agency and a Platform, as well as the journeys our users were taking through both.

			Findings	
		</div>
		<div class="casestudycontent">
			<p>
			We wanted to create a software enabled marketplace, so we needed everything to be within the Scrunch platform, which meant our Agency needed to be transferred into the app. We were left with 6 user journeys that needed to be consolidated into 3. 
			</p>
			<p>
			1. Agency (Managed)<br>
			2. Agency (In-App)<br>
			3. Influencer (Managed)<br>
			4. Influencer (In-App)<br>
			5. Brand/Client (Managed)<br>
			6. Brand (In-App)<br>
			</p>
			<p>
			to
			</p>
			<p>
			1. Agency (= managed)<br>
			2. Brand<br>
			3. Influencer<br>
			</p>
			<p>
			This marketplace would be built with a robust sharing & permissions system tailored for ‘Agencies’ to allow control of their clients. We wanted to introduce programmatic communications: reminders, outreach, updates, all done through notifications and messages. This meant looking at how we were handing our users in a completely different fashion.

			Ideal state exploration and testing	
		</div>
		<div class="casestudycontent">
			<p>
			The first step we took was to group the current experiences into much higher level ‘stages’. There was 6 stages: pre-campaign, campaign preparation, client communication, influencer outreach/negotiation, influencer content, and post campaign report. 
			</p>
			<p>
			We leveraged these stages and the way things were currently being done to brainstorm an ideal experience. As long as each stage was complete in the process, we could improve the steps that were in-between to be more efficient.
			</p>
			<p>
			We mapped out a step-driven experience map for the ideal state. We went through multiple feedback sessions and adjusted the ideal state map until it was solid. We defined goals and aligned the experience of the product’s outcomes to them. We  then validated the map internally until there was a possible direction/vision.

			Low-fidelity Wireframing
		</div>
		<div class="casestudycontent">
			<p>
			We used the ideal state map to create low-fidelity wireframes. This initially followed the journey of each persona without considering how they would overlap with one-another. We then printed out all the wireframe screens and placed them across the wall so we could physically map the connections between personas and product.
			</p>
			<p>
			We then walked through each of the wire frames with staff members and collected feedback based on their questions and concerns. We adjusted the wireframes.

			High-fidelity Wireframing
		</div>
		<div class="casestudycontent">
			<p>
			We moved the wireframes to slightly higher fidelity designs and added context to the screens so that the users who we were testing with could empathise with the experience. We added additional states, screens and journeys to create individual prototypes for each persona and their unique journeys. This was done using Invision.

			Mock-ups
		</div>
		<div class="casestudycontent">
			<p>
			By this time, we had finished our project goal, which was to create a fully click-through end-to-end wireframe prototype of the Scrunch Platform. *self high five* 
			</p>
			<p>
			The idea in using this was to design one project at a time based on the company’s highest priority, handover to developers and then start on the next project using this framework. In this case, the highest priority was to look into Scrunch’s directory. You can see below some not-quite finished mockups of how that might look like. 
			</p>
			<p>
			I had just started working on the interface when I finished up my time at Scrunch. As such, while these are concept mock-ups co desgin team Gangplank and I put forward, they might not be the final design Scrunch ends up using.

			Improvments
		</div>
		<div class="casestudycontent">
			<p>
			I really enjoyed working on this project in my last months at Scrunch. It was heavily research and discovery based which I really enjoyed, and it felt like I was contributing to a big part of the company’s direction. I would have really enjoyed spending more time diving into the UI.
			</p>
			<p>
			Looking back, probably one of the main aspects I would do differently is documenting our results from our testing sessions separately. Whenever we had input from one of the stakeholders, we found ourselves updating the models directly, rather than writing down their feedback, making a note of the changes and applying them. We don’t have any of that documented anywhere which is a shame.  
			</p>
			<p>
			I would probably not have spent as much time digitising all of our earlier maps. There were so many changes between the first and final version of the maps that digitising could have been done at a later date or revisited if needed. The whole project would most likely have been able to be finished quicker. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Other than that, I am extremely happy with the outcome of this project. 
			</p>
