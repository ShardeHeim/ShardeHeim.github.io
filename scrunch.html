			Scrunch is an Influencer Marketing Platform that matches 20 million influencers to brands and agencies globally. 
			</p>
			<p>
			During my time at Scrunch, I worked on a number of projects including redesigning the end to end web app experience, a mobile app designed just for Influencers, skeleton personas, front end development and design for the Scrunch website, preset development and general content for the company.

		<h2>END TO END EXPERIENCE MAP PROJECT</h2>
		<div class="casestudytitle">
		The Challenge	
		</div>
		<div class="casestudycontent">
			<p>
			The goal of the end-to-end Scrunch project was to map out the user’s complete journey through the platform, to use as a foundation when moving forward with new features and products. 
			</p>
			<p>
			My role in the project was to investigate the current user journey of Scrunch. I then tested and updated what that looked like across Scrunch’s different personas and a multitude of use cases.

		Early stage expoloration and research	
		</div>
		<div class="casestudycontent">
		<p>
			We began by researching the current process. We analysed the journeys of Scrunch’s three main personas and their communication channels. These included: emails, notifications, Hubspot events etc.
		</p>
		<p>
			We roughly sketched the steps of each user’s journey. We then conducted user interviews with Scrunch’s stakeholders to validate what we had mapped.
		</p>
		</div>

			<p>
			Each interview lead to updates to the experience. We digitised each of the user flows so it was easier to consume. In the example below, red markers indicate where the Scrunch platform was being used, while other colours represent other mediums.

		<div class="casestudycontent">
			<p>
			Our last step was to sketch out where the three personas correlated and where the touch points were. We drew up four different panels marking out the steps, and noted when any of them required input from the other persona.

			Consolidation	
		</div>
		<div class="casestudycontent">
			<p>
			Our research helped us realise that we hadn’t addressed the fact that users would take different journeys if they were involved with an in-app or managed campaign.
			</p>
			<p>
			Using sticky notes, we mapped out a higher level of detail of the 6 journeys and their interactions in-between.  
			</p>
			<p>
			Our consolidated map gave us an extensive look into Scrunch as an Agency and a Platform, as well as the journeys our users were taking through both.

			<p>
			To create a software-enabled marketplace, we needed everything to be within the Scrunch platform. We were left with six user journeys that needed to be consolidated into three.

			2. Agency (In-App)<br>
			3. Influencer (Managed)<br>

			Ideal state exploration and testing

			<p>
			We grouped the current experiences into six higher-level stages: pre-campaign, campaign preparation, client communication, influencer outreach and negotiation, influencer content, and post campaign report.
			</p>
			<p>
			We leveraged these stages and the way things were currently being done to brainstorm an ideal experience.

		<div class="casestudycontent">
			<p>
			Using the ideal state map, we created low-fidelity wireframes. We then printed out all the wireframe screens and placed them across the wall so we could physically map the connections between personas and product.
			</p>
			<p>
			We then walked through each of the wire frames with staff members and collected feedback based on their questions and concerns.

			We moved the wireframes to slightly higher fidelity designs adding additional states, screens and journeys to create individual prototypes for each persona and their unique journeys. This was done using Invision.
			</p>
			<p>
			We asked internal members to interact with the prototypes and collected feedback based on their actions.

			Going forward this complete prototype would be used for continuous development of Scrunch’s highest priorities. Scrunch’s directory was top of the list. You can see below some mockups of how that might look.

			I had just started working on the interface when I finished up my time at Scrunch. As such, while these are concept mock-ups that co design team Gangplank and I put forward, they might not be the final design Scrunch ends up using.

			Improvements
		</div>
		<div class="casestudycontent">
			<p>
			I really enjoyed working on this project during my last months at Scrunch: it felt like I was making a large contribution to the company’s direction.
			</p>
			<p>
			One of the main aspects I would do differently is separately documenting testing session results. We updated the models directly rather than writing down stakeholder feedback. 
			</p>
			<p>
			I would also not have spent as much time digitising all our earlier maps. There were so many changes between the first and final version that digitising could have been done at a later date.
			</p>
			<p>
