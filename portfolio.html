			I put together some of the key projects I have worked on in the last few years.
			</p>
			<p>
			I decided to treat the process like I would any other UX problem, with research, early stage design, testing and mockups. I also built my site using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Because of this, I chose to include it as one of my porfolio's case studies, as it highlights my design process well.

		The Challenge	
		</div>
		<div class="casestudycontent">
			<p>
			The goal of this project was to consolidate my best works in an easy to consume website. I also wanted to give myself a personal brand identity.
			</p>
			<p>
			My role in the project was to investigate other top UX designers portfolios, do some early design exploration and testing, create my brand, high-fidelity designs and mockups and finally develop the site.

		Research	
		</div>
		<div class="casestudycontent">
			<p>
			I did some research and found a 2019 article on the top 21 UX resumes and their designers, creatives who work at Google, Facebook, Spotify ect.
			</p>
			<p>
			I followed through each resume to the designers individual portfolios, where I quickly realised there were two main formats being using. Individual cards in a grid formate, or large, full width scroll through cards of their work.

		Early Design Sketches	
		</div>
		<div class="casestudycontent">
			<p>
			I sketched out what each of the two types of portfolios might look like. I got some advice from a fellow designer that ended up shaping my decision. He told me people would take my least impressive piece of work and set that as the bench mark on what I can do. Make sure I was only putting my best forward.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="casestudyimage">
			<img src="images/portfoliosketches.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<p>
			I had a long look at the work I was happy with representing my skills, which ended up being about 4 case studies, so the second design suited me better at this stage of my carer.

		Branding
		</div>
		<div class="casestudycontent">
			<p>
			Before I could start with the higher fedlity designs of my site, I needed to do some self branding.  First I needed a logo. I did some rough sketchs of different plays on my initials SH and my name. I wanted to convey my personality across the most effectively. 
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="casestudyimage">
			<img src="images/logosketches.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<p>
			I did a round of testing with Graphic and UX Designers, and the two logos that was selected the most was my full name in cursive and the logo you come to see now circled in green. I mocked up both, and ultimate decided on the S, as it took up less space and looked more professional as a whole.   
		</p>
		<div class="casestudyimage">
			<img src="images/logolines.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<p>
			Deciding on my colours was relatively easy. I wanted to convey a sense of professionalism with a little bit of fun and spunk, which I found myself to be. While I was on my honeymoon in the Maldives, I took a photo of a sunset.
		</p>
		<p>
			The colours was such a good balance of cool professionalism with the darker navy and the warmer orange and yellow tones to bring in some life, I used it as a bases to figure out my first round of colour values.

		Higher Fidelity Designs	
		</div>
		<div class="casestudycontent">
			<p>
			Now that I had my logo, color range and the decided format of my potfolio, I started on some higher fidelity designs.  I went through a couple of different variations of colour using Sketch.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="casestudyimage">
			<img src="images/homepagedifferentcolours.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<p>
			I conducted some testing sessions with the different coloured home page designs and their was an overwhelming preference towards the dark navy. “It’s more professional and you can always use pops of colour in your illustrations” was the main feedback.   
		</p>
		<div class="casestudyimage">
			<img src="images/scrunchdifferenthomepages.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<p>
			I designed the layout of the first version of the home page. I went through a lot of different combinations of tiles and perspective layouts. I initially had the four different sections but ended up using only three.

			<p>
			It only took a couple of days to finish building my site. I hosted it on Github Pages which made everything nice and easily. The task that cosumed the most time was making everything responsive for all different devices. For the Sunbrella section in particular, the image gets swapped out depending on the size of your screen.

		Final round of testing

		<div class="casestudycontent">
			<p>
			I sent my finished portfolio to a  several recruiters to gather feedback.  The main three main critics was that there needed to be a way of going to the next/previous project from one case study, because scrolling all the way to the top was too hard. The images on mobile need to be larger and I need to condense my words more.

		What I would do differently next time
		</div>
		<div class="casestudycontent">
			<p>
			I am really happy with how my portfolio turned out. It was something that I had put off for a long time which I am glad I finished. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Next time, I would probably spend longer on my initial personality branding, researching and conducting more surveys on the type of designer and person I am, and designing for that feel rather that what I thought looked good.  
			</p>
			<p>
			Feel free to reach out and give me feedback on your experience looking at my work. I am always looking to improve my website.
