			Living in Australia, the sun is a damaging and harmful part of our country. 2/3 Australians will be diagnosed with some form of skin cancer by age 70. For my final year university project, my teammate Melissa Nguyen and I decided to tackle this issue. 
			</p>
			<p>
			In 13 weeks we investigated, tested, built and finally presented a working prototype at our end-of-semester installation exhibit at South Bank’s ‘The Edge’. The <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/uq-interaction-design-exhibit-2017-tickets-34451098162#" target="_blank"> exhibit</a>  showcased emerging interactive technologies for the general public to come and enjoy. Our team ended up being chosen to speak at a local school on the subject of ‘women in technology’.

		Inspiration	
		</div>
		<div class="casestudycontent">
		<p>
		At the start of our project exploration, we hadn’t yet decided on which issue we wanted to tackle. The only university requirement was to design a playful and open-ended interaction for everyday life, focusing on designing for a human value (e.g. social connection, well-being, curiosity). 
		</p>
		<p>
		We began by considering aspects of existing projects that we enjoyed that we could incorporate into our project. Some of these included the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl_0BfPlJYc" target="_blank">Drink-Up</a> fountain which was a water fountain that spoke to you every time you drank from it. We also looked into smart objects such as bins and roads that take in information that is usually hidden from us and presented them in a more useful and accessible way.
		</p>
		<p>
		We were researching common problems Australians face when we first thought about sun safety. We wanted our project to have a strong purpose and we felt as though Sun awareness and protection was particularly relevant for everyday users in sunny Australia.
		</p>
		<p>
		We found this video by Thomas Leveritt on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9BqrSAHbTc" target="_blank">How The Sun Sees You</a>, which sparked our first idea. We were inspired by how people were able to visualise what their skin looked like to the sun and we wanted to create the same effect with our installation.

			Initial Proposal
		</div>
		<div class="casestudycontent">
			<p>
			We thought about what elements of previously successful campaigns, such as slip-slop-slap by the Cancer Council Queensland, could be incorporated. In our own experience, people were most likely to seek shade or shelter and use sunscreen if it was available to them.
			</p>
			<p>
			Ultraviolet Rays (UV) cause skin cancer. Our problem was that they are invisible. We wanted to turn the invisible visible. The current standard measurement for UV in Australia is the UV Index, a coloured scale from 0 - 11. 
			</p>
			<p>
			We came up with the idea of a beach shack or hut filled with black light, the walls covered by mirrors. There would be two doors to the hut and no windows. At the entry, there would be fixed bottles of sunscreen that users would apply before going inside. They would walk through the shack and look at themselves in the mirror, seeing parts of their body blacked out by the sunscreen. There would be a UV sensor at the top of the hut that read the UV index for that day. Lights would be projected inside the hut that matched the colour of the UV.

			Testing and Initial Issues

		<div class="casestudycontent">
			<p>
			We pitched this concept to our cohort and recieved a mixed response. While many thought that the idea was unique and utilised the technology really well, there was concerns about achieving it within the time frame, our limited team members and that overall the scope was just too big. 
			</p>
			<p>
			We may have been aiming too high for the context of this class, but we really wanted to keep our theme of sun safety and making the invisible visible.

			Early Design Exploration 
		</div>
		<div class="casestudycontent">
			<p>
			Having moved on from our hut idea, we went through many iterations and refinements until we came up with the design of the ‘Sunbrella’. We decided on an interactive circular café umbrella and stand that was designed to sit on top of a round group café table.
			</p>
			<p>
			In our research, Melissa and I found that a lot of Australians associated sun damage with the visable sun, not with UV . We had to find a way to enlighten the Australian public about a phenomenon they couldn’t see. Adopting the UV index measurement, we designed the umbrella canopy to contain LED lights that changed colour over the course of the day matching the current UV index.
			</p>
			<p>
			It was our belief that individuals would be able to register with a colour more quickly and easily than blocks of information, no matter how beneficial that information was. Humans are visual beings. From a distance the colours act almost as a beacon to the public.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="casestudyimage">
			<img src="images/sunbrellasketch.jpg"/>
		</div>

		<div class="casestudycontent">
			<p>
			The canopy on the underside of the umbrella would be interactive for those who were sitting underneath. It would contain three segments. The first highlighted what colour the current outside UV was. This would include information about how harmful it was, the UV index predictions throughout the day, as well as protection measures. 
			</p>
			<p>
			The second section would be a number of sun-safe activities you could participate in, as well as a map of the local area and the best sun-safe routes. 
			</p>
			<p>
			The last would be a weather segment, showcasing the current weather and temperature. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Participants underneath the umbrella would be able to interact with it using a controller ring around the base of the umbrella stand. They would be able to swivel and select features of the umbrella using this controller.

			Prototype Build
		</div>
		<div class="casestudycontent">
			<p>
				We wanted to build a mini-version of our Sunbrella, enough to test it without investing too much time. We would use a projector to project our displays on the underside of the canopy. We would use MakeyMakey and Unity to program the controller to change between the different segments. 
			</p>
			<p>
				We wanted to first focus on the physical interactions and how the system would respond. The display would only be mockups for now, but would later on be turned into dynamic displays.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first problem we faced when building the prototype canopy was making it sturdy enough. We built the rims out of joined pipes and bull clipped fabric over the top to create a covering. While we knew it was still a prototype and didn’t need to be polished, we needed to be able to work with a more durable structure. In the end, we decided the best approach was to just purchase a café umbrella canopy and work under that.

		<div class="casestudycontent">
			<p>
			We used a MakeyMakey kit to change from one segment underneath the canopy to another. We had different wires connected to the weather, the sun safe activity segment and the UV index information section. An aluminium controller was wrapped around the base of our umbrella and when we tapped on one of the different sections, it would display that segment on a computer.
			</p>
			<p>
			The purpose of this was for testing, so users can get a real feel of how the controller might work and change the interactions. The wires were fed through the Sunbrella table base and onto aluminium pads that sat on the top of the table.

			Feedback from prototype testing session
		</div>
		<div class="casestudycontent">
			<p>
			We gave our prototype Sunbrella over to our cohort to play with. The biggest problem we found was that users didn’t like the controller at all. Pushing up into the canopy direction didn’t come naturally as a way of going into a segment, and the turn felt clumsy and unresponsive. They had trouble going from segment to segment. 
			</p>
			<p>
			From this, we decided to change the controller and use it more as a pointer than a steering wheel. We would look into how we could use table objects, such a salt shaker, to control the interface. We also changed the sections so that they weren’t segmented anymore, but rather all on the one interface. They will be moving around on the canopy and users can point to a section they want to know more about.

			Exhibition build
		</div>
		<div class="casestudycontent">
			<p>
			Taking all the feedback from our prototype session into our next stage, we still needed to finish off our build for the exhibition. At this point we hadn’t finished installing our LED lights and we had to change the segments under the canopy and how users would interact with them.
			</p>
			<p>
			Our first problem occurred when our neopixel lights arrived damaged. The first 10 or so LED strips wouldn’t receive power, resulting in the whole 4 meters not displaying any light. It took us a lot of troubleshooting to find the fault and eventually we cut away and reconnected the strip about 30 cm down from its original length.

			We coded the light to work with our UV sensor. When you hovered a UV torch over the sensor, the lights would change color to match the increase in UV. When it was removed, it would return back to a low UV level green. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Once it all worked with the sensor, we worked to secure the necessary wires to the underside of the canopy and out on top of the umbrella, hand stiching the LED lights to the outside of the sunbrella.

			Melissa and I came up with the idea of bouncing circles of advice and information on the UV index that would move around the underside of the canopy.  We also added in a staff calling section that, if selected, would call a staff member to your table.
			</p>
			<p>
			We chose clouds as the shape of the bubbles which contained moving information, and a sun as the cursor. The UV bubbles displayed the UV index and once you hovered over them, forecast UV for the week was displayed as a graph.

			We settled on a salt and pepper shaker that acted as a controller, using fiducial codes as our way of tracking the movements.  We attached a camera to the underside of the umbrella that mapped the fiducial code’s movements. 
			</p>
			<p>
			We had to test with several sizes of the ID’s as the light from our projector obscured the details in the picture and it was hard to read.

			Geolocation and Snapchat

		<div class="casestudycontent">
			<p>
			We designed such that each Sunbrella would have a geo location filter associated with its position, and that a Snapchat information cloud would display the photos of the people who used the filter. 
			</p>
			<p>
			This was designed with two reasons in mind. One, to make it a more social installation and gather attraction to the Sunbrella. The longer they spend under it the more exposed they are to information. They can begin associating it with a color and deepening their cognitive memory of that UV index. Two, we wanted to highlight that even though it might be a cloudy or completely different weather scenario to what you expect, the UV can still be damaging.

			<p>
			For our final exhibit, we did find that the UV lights were initially what attracted users over to the installation where they then asked about the information displayed on the underside of the canopy. When explaining the principle behind the lights to users, they responded to it very well and could see how it would work.

			Improvments
		</div>
		<div class="casestudycontent">
			<p>
			For a real-life product of the Sunbrella, using a projector to project information is not realistic. It would be hard to read in bright light and any movement in front of the projector would disrupt the screen. The real-world product would have to have some type of thin, bendable screens that make up each section of the umbrella´s canopy. The information would still bounce around across the screen, however, it would be much more durable and reliable. 
			</p>
			<p>
			A real-world installation would have a canopy that contained lights that were exceptionally durable to the elements and could withstand long periods of sun and rain. In our prototype, the lights were only sewn onto the umbrella to cut down on time and cost of attaching it using a more studier method.
			</p>
			<p>
			I feel that though we provided a unique portrayal of information, it ended up being more of an installation that brought awareness to the danger of UV, rather than actively targeted people’s behavior towards the Sun. Though to some degree I believe we did achieve what we set out to achieve, further improvements could definitely be made to solidify this idea.
